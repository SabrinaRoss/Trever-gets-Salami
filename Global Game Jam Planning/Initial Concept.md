Comedy will be whatever I think off, giving player multiple routes, and choices. Instead of death will be other silly situations.  
  
Act as though, each person you talk to is a boss and you must option your way out of the situation.  
  
Joy of this is if complete, can add more.  
  
Replay value.  
  
Potential to be really funny.  
  
Like a visual novels, but point and click and henry stickman

In board game format  
  
The board is a grocery store, and like mario party you move up the board.  
  
But the board is a type of slay the spire type thing, with branching paths etc.  
  
Each option in diagoge will bring you to a diffrent direction then to diff event.  
  
After each dialouge, map shown and a red line is jotted for the direction and paht the player took to next event, whole map also shown so where final destination is.
