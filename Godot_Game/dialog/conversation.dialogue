Trevor: Salami now!

Trevor's thoughts: No you do not, the developer of this game is tired after working for 18 hours straight scripting this shit, and still has to do assignments tommorrow so that he does not get behind in his Calculus, not to mention 2 unrelated midterm. So do me a favour kid and hand over the Salami for the Developers sake.
